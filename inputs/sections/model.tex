	\section{Model.}

		Consider a set of measurements $(x_i,y_i)$, $i = 1,\dots ,N$, composed
		of independent and identically distributed random variables. $X$ represents 
		measurements of resources consumption
		by content requests, that takes values in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In our target 
		values $Y$, there are two classes, defined as follows:

		\[
			Y = \begin{cases}
        								+1  & \mbox{if the content is popular} \\
       								-1   & \mbox{otherwise}
        						\end{cases}
		\]

		Assuming that there exists a unknown joint probability $\operatorname{Pr}(X,Y)$, 
		we seek a function $f(X)$, $f : X \rightarrow Y$, for predicting $\hat{Y}$ 
		given values of the input $X$. We are interested in \emph{learning} 
		the function $f$, in a such way that the misclassification or risk function ,
		$r : Y \times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, is minimized.
